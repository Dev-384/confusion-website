# Confusion

## What is this place?

Have you ever had an idea, but no where to put it? What about multiple projects, stored with no organization?

**THIS** is a place for those kinds of things. Random projects, keeped nice and tidy!

## How

Each project is asigned a single `PROJECT.md` file, and a folder to put all demo files in.

The markdown file will be located at `/projects/markdown/PROJECT.md`
The demos will be locaded in `/project/demo/PROJECT`

If you want to attach a project from an external source, just put the following at the TOP of your projects markdown file:

<br>

If there is no demo page for your project, put:

```md
...
link: none
...
```

If there is a demo on an external source, using the markdown link format:

```md
...
link: (LINK)[URL]
...
```
