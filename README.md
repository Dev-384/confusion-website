# Confusion

## What is this place?

Have you ever had an idea, but no where to put it? What about multiple projects, stored with no organization?

**THIS** is a place for those kinds of things. Random projects, that don't have to make sense!

## How

Each project is asigned a single `PROJECT.md` file, and a folder to put all demo files in.

The markdown file will be located at `/projects/markdown/PROJECT.md`
The demos will be locaded in `/project/demo/PROJECT`
